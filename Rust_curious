What if I borrow a value in a function, but move it to
another function inside the function.
    === Since you are passing the var you borrowed, when you
    transfer it, it is being borrowed. Not owned.

let j = (mut d)
j (which is now a shadow to d) is now immutable

N.divmod(D) == N/D ??
Do bitshift operators work on ramp::int::Int
