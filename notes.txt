------ PROJECT NOTES -----------------

1. Generate a key pair using openssl
    a. openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

2. Draw the public key from the private one.
    openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout

3. Encrypting a file:
    openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey public.pem -pubin -in file.txt -out file.ssl

4. openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in file.ssl decrypted.txt

2. The "key pair" generated above is what is per standards, called
as "private key". It has the public key parts as well as some
preperformed computations to speed up decryption (using something
called a "Chinese Remainder Theorem")

3. The 'keys' are number pairs. Here in too. (n,e) is the public
key; (n,d) is the private key.

4. e is for some reason not randomised. It is often a specific well
known constant (65537) or is often among a few well known constants.

5. So the modus operandi is to command a 'private key' (has pub key
info within it too) then draw out the public key from it and publish it.
