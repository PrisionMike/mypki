Proof of concept app.

Generates prime numbers from a quantum RNG source. // TODO: Insert link here.

Now the API is slow. Slower, now that they have capped it to 1 request per second. So the idea is to test the speed at which this app can generate Prime numbers, with and without that API.

A more practical idea would be to have online RNG testing here. But maybe later.
